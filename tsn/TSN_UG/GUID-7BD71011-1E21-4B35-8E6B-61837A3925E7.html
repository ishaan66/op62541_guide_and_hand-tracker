<p>In a general purpose operating system (GPOS), round-robin (RR) time-sharing process scheduling allows each process to use the processor for a short period of processing time, known as a time slice or quantum. The RR time-sharing scheduling policy ensures fairness in processor bandwidth usage for all processes, and from the end user perspective, all processes appear to be equally responsive. The Linux kernel meets the need of general purpose usages in personal computers, mobile devices, and data centers by using RR time-sharing process scheduling.

The development of PREEMPT_RT patch happens outside of the Linux mainline. Below is a list of git repositories for real-time Linux:

<p> Intel's Production Kernel release at

        <a href="www.kernel.org" target="_blank">www.kernel.org</a>) and includes the kernel branch containing the PREEMPT_RT patch. For example, git branch "4.14/preempt-rt" is the kernel branch that contains patches from

      </p>
<p> The Linux kernel since version 2.6 is a preemptive kernel. This means the kernel scheduler can preempt a process at any point, as long as the kernel is in a state that is safe to reschedule, such as, when the kernel is not holding a lock to a critical section. A lock is also used by the Linux kernel to mark a particular region of kernel code that is non-preemptive. To make the Linux kernel real-time, many of the PREEMPT_RT patches are related to increase the section of kernel code that is preemptive. For additional details, read more about

<div class="section" id="GUID-91268490-7FC1-4CE8-B5BB-2B2F550F6B4B"><h2 class="sectiontitle"> Process Scheduling Policy </h2><p> Each thread managed by the kernel has its own choice of scheduling policy and scheduling priority. The kernel scheduler decides which runnable thread will be scheduled based on the knowledge of scheduling policy and scheduling priority. The scheduling policies are categorized into normal and real-time. 
      </p>
<p> The normal scheduling policies are: 
      </p>
<ul id="GUID-A39A45B3-2BD3-4B5B-B1CB-710CC92F43FB"><li> SCHED_OTHER 
        </li>
<li>SCHED_IDLE 
        </li>
<li>SCHED_BATCH 
        </li>
</ul>
<p> The real-time scheduling policies are: 
      </p>
<ul id="GUID-F88D74B9-035A-4AEB-B3DE-D3B7A9A734D1"><li> SCHED_FIFO 
        </li>
<li>SCHED_RR 
        </li>
<li>SCHED_DEADLINE (since Linux v3.14) 
        </li>
</ul>
<p> For a normal thread, we typically use the SCHED_OTHER policy and set the 
        <em>nice</em> value (range from -20 to 19) of the process. A process with a high nice value allows the kernel scheduler to preempt it before the end of its process execution time-slice for other process, that is, being nice to other process. Within the kernel, the nice value is mapped into the static priority of the process at the location that is after the highest value of static priority for real-time scheduling policy. A real-time thread always has a higher static priority than a normal thread. 
      </p>
<p> For a real-time thread, we may choose either SCHED_FIFO or SCHED_RR and set the scheduling priority value. A SCHED_FIFO thread, once scheduled, continues to run until it blocks or explicitly reschedules itself. It does not have an execution time-slice and may run forever. SCHED_RR is similar to SCHED_FIFO, except that it has a time-slice value. Both SCHED_FIFO and SCHED_RR are listed in the POSIX.1 standard and can be configured by using a pthread API such as 
        <samp class="codeph">pthread_setschedparam()</samp> . 
      </p>
<p> SCHED_DEADLINE is a newer real-time scheduling policy supported by the Linux kernel that is not part of the POSIX.1 standard, and is therefore not supported by pthread API. To use the SCHED_DEADLINE policy, use the Linux-specific 
        <samp class="codeph">sched_setattr()</samp>API. The SCHED_DEADLINE policy is suitable for a real-time sporadic task that executes just once per period of time (that is, per cycle time) and has a specific limit on the duration the sporadic task may use to complete its execution, that is the deadline. 
      </p>
<p> Since Linux version 2.6.3, the default kernel scheduler for normal scheduling policy has been Completely Fair Scheduler (kernel/sched/fair.c). For real-time scheduling policy, it is the real-time kernel scheduler (kernel/sched/rt.c). The kernel scheduler always schedules the thread that has the highest static priority from the list of runnable threads that the kernel scheduler maintains. The static priority of a normal scheduling policy is lower than that of a real-time scheduling policy. The static priority of SCHED_DEADLINE is higher than SCHED_FIFO and SCHED_RR.

<div class="section" id="GUID-CD60BEA9-852C-4AB1-A555-E507980E056C"><h2 class="sectiontitle">Memory Locking in Real-Time Task </h2><p> Because memory starvation is an expensive event and introduces variable latencies into a real-time task, it is important to make sure that the memory/buffer space needed for real-time task is locked, that is, it is prefetched from memory into cache, and the free page for the memory usage is reserved for the real-time task.

<div class="section" id="GUID-6F2A4C94-A60C-43CF-9148-921307610EF7"><h2 class="sectiontitle">Real-Time System Latency </h2><p> The time a processor takes to complete a task is known as the latency of the task. In the context of RTOS, we want to understand the maximum latency of the RT task when the RT system is under the worst possible scenario. The real-time Linux kernel focuses on ensuring determinism in completing an RT task within the specified time budget and the determinism in RT task computation is characterized by measuring the maximum or worst latency to complete the RT task. 
      </p>
<p> Cyclictest is popularly used to measure the determinism of the real-time Linux. It is bundled into the rt-tests suite available from 
        <a href="https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/clrkwllms/rt-tests.git" target="_blank"> https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/clrkwllms/rt-tests.git</a>. Cyclictest has one non-real-time main thread (using the SCHED_OTHER process scheduling model) to activate many real-time priority multiple threads (using SCHED_FIFO process scheduling model). These real-time threads are activated at a defined interval by an expiring timer (cyclic alarm). Whenever a real-time thread wakes-up, it reports its current time to the master thread. 
      </p>
<p>The term 
        <em>latency</em> in cyclictest refers to the duration of an RT thread's wake-up sequence, starting from interrupt to when the RT is activated by the kernel scheduler. In the context of real-time performance monitoring, we are want to know the maximum latency for such wake-up sequence for an RT system. In other words, cyclictest is measuring the determinism of real-time Linux kernel in the area of interrupt handling and process scheduling. Open Source Automation Development Lab (OSADL) runs cyclictest measurement on multiple hardware across different Linux kernel version and the results are published regularly in its QA farm.
