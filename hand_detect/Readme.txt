Steps to run hand tracker:
1. run the test.py script by typing the command: python3 test.py
2. Wait for application to load.
3. Move you hand and cover the box on the screen. Press A to confirm. This will tell the program what color to track.
4. Tracking will now start. Moving your hand left, right, up, or down will print the corresponding direction at the 
top left corner of the screen. Closing your hand into a fist will also cause closed to be printed. Waving your hand
from left to right repeatedly results in waving to be printed, but this detection is not very accurate.
5. Press q to quit the program.
